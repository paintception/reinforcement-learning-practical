## Reading and presentation assignment

Students should handle in the following three deliverables:	

- Assignment 1: one coding assignment related to lecture 2. [pdf](assignments/assignment01/assignment01.pdf) 
- Assignment 2: one mathematical assignment related to lectures 3 and 4. [pdf](assignments/assignment02/Assignment02_corrected.pdf)
- Final Project: a reinforcement learning project of the student's choice 

Students are allowed to work alone or in groups of a maximum of **two** people.
